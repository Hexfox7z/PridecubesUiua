# PridecubesUiua
A uiua-based project that turns colour pallettes into cubes

Colour pallettes must be at least two colours large (Need a one color? Put the same colour twice!)
This only supports flag made of lines! If you want the line to go Up/down instead of Left/Right remove the ⤸2 (Line 22)
Want a flag instead of a cube? Change ⤸2↯[Xl Xl Xl 4] to ⤸2↯[1 ×÷3 5Xl Xl 4] (Line 22)
This CAN run base color pallettes! You can type in any base Uiua pallette constant you want :]
